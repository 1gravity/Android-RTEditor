/**
 * The RTMediaSource is used when a media is picked and inserted into the rich
 * text editor.
 * <p>
 * It contains meta information (name, mime type) and gives access to the
 * underlying InputStream through which the RTMediaFactory can create a Media
 * object which is then inserted into the editor. The creation of the Media
 * object requires some processing like copying the media to a dedicated media
 * storage area.
 * Splitting the actual copying of the file from retrieving the InputSource
 * (which includes picking the file and do some pre-processing e.g. when dealing
 * with ContentProviders) gives us the flexibility to implement any possible
 * storage scenario while keeping the "ugly stuff" under the hood.
