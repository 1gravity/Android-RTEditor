/**
 * The RTFormat class defines the format of an RTText.
 * <p>
 * It's not an enum because we need to be able to extend the pre-defined formats
 * (HTML, PLAIN_TEXT, SPANNED).
 * <p>
 * Extending the formats allows us to add custom conversions
 * (RTText.convertTo(RTFormat, RTMediaFactory)) and to add logic in custom
 * RTMedia implementations (RTMedia.getFilePath(RTFormat)) without breaking the
 * rest of the code.
 * <p>
 * We could e.g. return cid:picture.jpg for a html link to an image (<a
 * href="cid:picture.jpg">) if the output format is a mime message and the image
 * will be sent in an email. We could return database://picture.jpg if the
 * output is stored in a database (database://<db_id>/picture.jpg if we use
 * multiple databases) or content://picture.jpg if the image is served by a
 * content provider. We can basically add any information needed to retrieve the
 * image (or rather its file path) when converting it back to rich text (Spanned
 * text).
