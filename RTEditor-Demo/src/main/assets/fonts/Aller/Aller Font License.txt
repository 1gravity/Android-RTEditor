We recommend that the Licensee prints this End User Licence Agreement for further reference.

This Dalton Maag Ltd End User Licence Agreement (“EULA”) becomes a binding contract between the Licensee and Dalton Maag Ltd when the Licensee commences a Font Software download, or if the Licensee is acquiring Font Software on a permanent medium, when the Licensee opens the package in which the software is contained.

If the Licensee does not wish to be bound by the EULA, the Licensee cannot access, use or download the Font Software. Please read all of the EULA before agreeing to be bound by its terms and conditions.

The Licensee hereby agrees to the following:

1	The Licensee is bound by the EULA and acknowledges that all Use (as defined herein) of the Font Software (as defined herein) supplied by Dalton Maag is governed by the EULA.

2	“Dalton Maag” shall mean Dalton Maag Ltd, its successors and assignees, its parent and affiliated corporations, its authorized distributors, and any third party which has licensed to Dalton Maag any or all of the components of the Font Software supplied to the Licensee.

3	“Licensee” shall mean the individual, company, corporation, or other organization subject to this End User Licence Agreement due to their access or Use of Dalton Maag Font Software.

4	“Font Software” shall mean the software provided by Dalton Maag which, when used on an appropriate Device or Devices, generates typeface and typographic designs and ornaments. Font Software shall include all bitmap representations of typeface and typographic designs and ornaments created by or derived from the Font Software. Font Software includes upgrades, updates, related files, permitted copies, permitted conversions, and related documentation.

5	“Device” shall mean a hardware, software, or firmware component to which an individual is able to give commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise), regardless of the locations of the individual, the Device, or the Font Software.

6	“Use” of the Font Software shall be deemed to occur when an individual is able to give commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise) to a Device on which the Font Software is installed, regardless of the locations of the individual, the Device, or the Font Software.

7	“User” shall mean an individual giving commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise) to a Device on which the Font Software is installed, regardless of the locations of the individual, the Device, or the Font Software. Users do not need to be members of the Licensee’s organization or household, and may be members of the public.

8	“Licensed Unit” shall mean the number of simultaneous Users permitted by the Licence.

By way of illustration and not by way of limitation, an electronic book, electronic magazine, or computer game shall all be considered Digital Products. A separate OEM/ISV licence is required to use Dalton Maag Font Software in Digital Products.

The Licensee may not use the Font Software to electronically distribute a Digital Product without a separate licence from Dalton Maag authorizing the Licensee to do so.

14	The Licensee shall not install, access or Use the Font Software until it has paid the applicable licence fee in full, or received an invoice for the licence fee and that invoice has not yet reached its due date, or been given written authorization to Use the Font Software by Dalton Maag.
